# Tweeter Project

This is a single page Twitter clone project which showcases some nice front end features using HTML, CSS,JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX.

The app features a responsive design for optimization on mobile, tablet and large screen devices.

I implemented all of the front-end features as part of my course requirements while studying at Lighthouse labs. The server side functionality for the app was however provided to me prior to the build.

## Highlighted Features

1. Responsive Design
2. AJAX - Allows the page to refresh tweets without requiring a full reload
3. Animated menu button
4. Slide down text input box
5. 'Back to top' button appears on scroll
6. Realtime character counter displays red when it goes over the maximum characters
7. Slide down error messages for empty text box or too many characters on submit
8. Showcase individual tweet and reveal username on hover
9. Rendering of tweets/HTML done with JavaScript
